   <h2>What is Chess?</h2>
   <p>Chess is a two-player turn-based board game that has been played for EONS, ok maybe not. It is known for its
    complex rules
    that allow players to show their merit through different strategies. Some even say learning to play good chess will
    make you smarter!</p>
   <h2>History of Chess</h2>
   <p>Chess has a rich history that dates back to ancient India during the Gupta dynasty, the more you know! It has
    evolved over the years and spread to different
    parts of the world, each region adding its unique elements to the game like shogi and chaturanga. Today, chess is
    played and enjoyed by
    millions of people worldwide.</p>
   <h2>Chess Rules</h2>
   <p>
    Chess is played on an 8x8 grid. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one
    queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate (KILL in cold blood) your
    opponent's
    king
    while protecting your own. Here are some key rules for the pieces:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>The king moves one square in any direction.</li>
    <li>The queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally any number of squares.</li>
    <li>Rooks move horizontally and vertically any number of squares.</li>
    <li>Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that.</li>
    <li>Bishops move diagonally any number of squares.</li>
    <li>Pawns move forward one square but capture diagonally.</li>
    <li>Castling allows the king and rook to move together to protect the king.</li>
    <li>Pawns can be promoted to any other piece if they reach the opponent's back rank.</li>
   </ul>
